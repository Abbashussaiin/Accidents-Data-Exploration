# Accidents-Data-Exploration
A exploratory data analysis for accidents that occured all across USA
# Introduction
Accidents happen all the time, but no one expects them to. It's why they're accidents. Everyone has an opinion on how accidents occur, but no one thinks about it until after the fact. Accidents and their consequences are a major problem in society today. To solve this matter, we can observe and analyse accident factors. By accident factors I mean the external factors that lead to accidents. My goal with this report is to categorize what contributes to accidents, in order to provide insight into how accidents happen , and gather information that can be shown graphically to help break down the aspects that lead to these unfortunate situations. We can then use these insights to potentially prevent future accidents by addressing potential risk factors.
# Dataset
Data used is freely available on the Kaggle website .  This accident dataset is a nation wide vehicle accident dataset that spans 49 states in the United States. The accident data collected spans over 1.5 million data sets from February 2016 to December 2020, and is based on a variety of open data sets made available through various government portals.
# Analysis of Dataset	
The dataset consist of 1516064 rows and 47 columns. The first part of this analysis was getting an overview of the data and to see what different aspects contribute directly during an accident. Some of the aspects that I feel is directly related to an accident is being discussed below.
